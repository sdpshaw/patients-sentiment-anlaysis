At a specialized hospital, a team of doctors conducted a survey to assess the emotional well-being of their patients. During the survey, they diligently recorded the daily emotions experienced by these patients.
With a substantial volume of data, they aim to automate the process of categorizing patient emotions into the following categories: sadness, joy, anger, love, fear, and surprise. 
We want you to analyze the responses and appropriately assign the emotional categories.
